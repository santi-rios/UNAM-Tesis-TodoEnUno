## Introduction {#sec-intro}

*TODO* Create a template that demonstrates the appearance, formatting, layout, and functionality of your format. Learn more about journal formats at <https://quarto.org/docs/journals/>. [@CameronTrivedi2013].

> In Quarto, we can do these by setting the fig-env command to figure* or SCfigure*

```r
#| label: fig-side
#| fig-cap: "This legend would be placed at the side of the figure, rather than below it."
#| fig-env: "SCfigure*"
#| echo: false
# tell it the options as comments with a | and a space, as above.
# set echo: false to avoid printing this text
knitr::include_graphics('figs/frog.pdf')
```
